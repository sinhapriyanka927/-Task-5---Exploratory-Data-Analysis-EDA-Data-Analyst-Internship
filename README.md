# Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Data Analyst Internship

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build predictive models to identify whether a loan will be paid back or not, based on customer and loan-related data.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- EDA and preprocessing (missing values, feature encoding)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis using visualizations
- Handling imbalanced data (noted but not corrected)
- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
- XGBoost performed best with higher recall and f1-score.
- Class imbalance in the data affects performance; future work may include SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning.
- Feature importance can help financial institutions focus on key risk factors.

## ðŸ“Ž Files Included
- `task5_eda_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis
- `task5_report.pdf`: PDF summary of the analysis and results
